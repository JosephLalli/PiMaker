"""
This module contains functions related to calculating pi diversity from read counts.

Given numpy arrays of read counts at variable sites, this module implements the
formulas described in `Nelson and Hughes (2015)`_ to calculate pi diversity.

    Calculates 'pi math' from read counts.

    Per `Nelson and Hughes (2015)`_, pi is the sum of the product of the read
    counts of all possible nucleotide combinations (AC, AG, AT, CG, CT, GT).
    This function performs this math for all sites in the read count array.

        read_cts:
            A (number of samples x n x 4) array of read counts. n is an
            arbitrary number of nucleotide sites.

        A (number of samples x n x 7) array containing the total number of
        reads at each site for each sample in the third axis' 0 index,
        and then the (AC, AG, AT, CG, CT, GT) products of the number of reads
        for each site and each sample at nucleotides at indices 1-6.
